# Layer 2 - Data Link Layer

> __Unit Type__ - `Frame`

> __Device__ - `Switches`

> `Ethernet` is the most common implementation of `Layer 2`.

1. Where `Switches` occur. A switch's job is so get frames to a particular `physical address`:

    1. `Media Access Control (MAC) Address` - These are also known asL

        1. `Layer 2 Address` / `L2 Address`.

        2. `Hardware Address`.

        3. `Burned-in Address (BIA)`.

        4. `Physical Address` - NB: These do not run a the `physical layer`.
